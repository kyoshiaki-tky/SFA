We constructed a spectrum formation classifier (SFC) that optimizes a modified multiclass log-loss function incorporating the overlap weights between smple groups and a general classifier (GC) that optimizes a general multiclass log-loss function. This is based on the assumption that information prioritized in the SFC, derived by evaluating the differences between important information in SFC and that in GC, is critical for extracting factors that are important for the formation of overlaps and/or spectra. Based on this information, an approach for investigating the factors that contribute to spectrum and/or overlap formation was developed, called the spectrum formation approach (SFA).

The repository provides a jupyter notebook that analyzes synthetic data. This file as a template to enable various analyses.
Also, we provide some results of raw SFA analyses on synthetic and actual disease data using un-refactored codes by a html output format bundled with some pickled binary data.
